# DSPD_LAB_B2_141
This repository contains 6 C programs developed as part of the Data Structure and Program Design (DSPD) college practicals.
Each program demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees using clear and modular C implementations.

📂 Contents
Practical 1

A. Accept ‘n’ numbers into an array and calculate the sum of elements at odd and even positions.
B. Implement Binary Search algorithm with step-by-step output showing midpoints and index adjustments.
C. Create a structure Student with fields including average marks and sort the list of students in descending order using Bubble Sort.

Practical 2 — Stack (Array Implementation)

Menu-driven program to perform:

Push an element

Pop an element

Check Palindrome using Stack

Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow conditions

Display Stack status

Practical 3 — Queue (Array Implementation)

Menu-driven program to perform:

Insert an element

Delete an element

Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow

Display Queue status

Practical 4 — Singly Linked List

Program to:

Create a linked list of integers

Traverse and display the list

Display the number of nodes

Practical 5 — Binary Tree

Program to:

Insert multiple nodes into a Binary Tree

Perform Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals

Search for an element (Display “Found” or “NULL”)

Practical 6 — Binary Search Tree (BST)

Menu-driven program to:

Search an element in BST (Display “Found” or “NULL”)

Insert an element

Delete a leaf node

Exit
